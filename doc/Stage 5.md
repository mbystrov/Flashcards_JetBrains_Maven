## Stage 5/7: Menu, please!

### Description

Our users cannot create new flashcards all the time. It seems like a good idea to keep old but useful cards in storage
so we can use them later. Let's try to do that!

In this stage, you will improve the application's interactivity by having it ask the user for an action and perform it.
Also, it will provide additional functionality allowing the user to store flashcards in files for future use.

The program should support the following actions:

- add a card: `add`
- remove a card: `remove`
- load cards from file: `import`
- save cards to file: `export`
- ask for definitions of some random cards: `ask`
- exit the program: `exit`

You can use any format of separating to store cards in a file; tests do not check the content of the file, but they do
check that all the saved flashcards are loaded correctly.

When you load flashcards from a file, you shouldn't erase the cards that aren't in the file. If the imported flashcard
already exists, update its definition in the program memory. There won't be any conflict with definitions in the tests.

### Objectives

Print the message `Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):` each time the user is prompted for their
next action. The action is read from the next line, processed, and the message is output again until the user decides to
exit the program.

The program's behavior depends on the action the user inputs:

- `add` — create a new flashcard with a unique term and definition. After adding the card, output the
  message `The pair ("term":"definition") has been added`, where `"term"` is the term entered by the user
  and `"definition"` is the definition entered by the user.
- `remove` — ask the user for the term of the card they want to remove with the message Which card?, and read the user's
  input from the next line. If a matching flashcard exists, remove it from the set and output the message The card has
  been removed.. If there is no such flashcard in the set, output the
  message `Can't remove "card": there is no such card.`, where `"card"` is the user's input.
- `import` — print the line `File name:`, read the user's input from the next line, which is the file name, and import
  all the flashcards written to this file. If there is no file with such name, print the message `File not found.`.
  After importing the cards, print the message `n cards have been loaded.`, where n is the number of cards in the file.
  The imported cards should be added to the ones that already exist in the memory of the program. However, the imported
  cards have priority: if you import a card with the name that already exists in the memory, the card from the file
  should overwrite the one in memory.
- `export` — request the file name with the line `File name:` and write all currently available flashcards into this
  file. Print the message `n cards have been saved.`, where `n` is the number of cards exported to the file.
- `ask` — ask the user about the number of cards they want to be asked about and then prompt them for definitions, like
  in the previous stage.
- `exit` — print `Bye bye!` and finish the program.

### Examples

The symbol `>` represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** _the user removes an existing card and tries to remove a non-existent one_

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > France
    The definition of the card:
    > Paris
    The pair ("France":"Paris") has been added.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > France
    The card "France" already exists.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > Great Britain
    The definition of the card:
    > Paris
    The definition "Paris" already exists.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > remove
    Which card?
    > France
    The card has been removed.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > remove
    Which card?
    > Wakanda
    Can't remove "Wakanda": there is no such card.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > exit
    Bye bye!

**Example 2:** _the user uses files to import and export their flashcards; definitions of existing cards are updated
after import_

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > import
    File name:
    > ghost_file.txt
    File not found.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > Japan
    The definition of the card:
    > Tokyo
    The pair ("Japan":"Tokyo") has been added.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > Russia
    The definition of the card:
    > UpdateMeFromFile
    The pair ("Russia":"UpdateMeFromFile") has been added.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > import
    File name:
    > capitals.txt
    28 cards have been loaded.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > ask
    How many times to ask?
    > 1
    Print the definition of "Russia":
    > Moscow
    Correct!

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > export
    File name:
    > capitalsNew.txt
    29 cards have been saved.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > exit
    Bye bye!

**Example 3:** _the program asks for definitions several times_

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > a brother of one's parent
    The definition of the card:
    > uncle
    The pair ("a brother of one's parent":"uncle") has been added.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > add
    The card:
    > a part of the body where the foot and the leg meet
    The definition of the card:
    > ankle
    The pair ("a part of the body where the foot and the leg meet":"ankle") has been added.

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > ask
    How many times to ask?
    > 6
    Print the definition of "a brother of one's parent":
    > ankle
    Wrong. The right answer is "uncle", but your definition is correct for "a part of the body where the foot and the leg meet".
    Print the definition of "a part of the body where the foot and the leg meet":
    > ??
    Wrong. The right answer is "ankle".
    Print the definition of "a brother of one's parent":
    > uncle
    Correct!
    Print the definition of "a part of the body where the foot and the leg meet":
    > ankle
    Correct!
    Print the definition of "a brother of one's parent":
    > ??
    Wrong. The right answer is "uncle".
    Print the definition of "a part of the body where the foot and the leg meet":
    > uncle
    Wrong. The right answer is "ankle", but your definition is correct for "a brother of one's parent".

    Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit):
    > exit
    Bye bye!

_Note that all your outputs and user inputs should be on separate lines._
